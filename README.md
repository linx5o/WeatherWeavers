# WeatherWeavers

## Plan
### Start with GetWeatherUseCase
Create a use case that will get the weather from the api and return it to the presenter.

Application Business Rules: Michael - michaelcantprogram \
Interface Adapters: Manskim - junwei0102 \
Entity: William - hondapowerdd \
Other: Edison - linx5o

First we will start with creating the interfaces together. Then we will split up the work and work on our own parts.
